# Machine Learning with Java - Part 4 (Decision tree)

In my previous articles , we have seen the Linear Regression , Logistic Regression and Nearest Neighbor. This article focuses on Decision Tree Classification and its sample usecase.

# Decision Tree
Decision Trees are a classic supervised learning algorithms. 
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance-event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. The decision tree algorithm can be used for solving the regression and classification problems too. 
The main goal of decision tree is to achieve perfect classification with minimum number of decision and it is not always possible due to inconsistencies of data.

# Decision Tree Algorithm

The Pesudocode for the decision tree algorithm is below,

1. Select the best attribute of the dataset as a root of the tree.
2.
